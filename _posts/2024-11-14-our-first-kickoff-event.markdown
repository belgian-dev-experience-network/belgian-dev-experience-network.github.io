# The Era of AAP: Ai Augmented Programming (using Java)

As we enter the era of AI-Augmented Programming (AAP), developers stand at the threshold of a profound shift in software creation and maintenance. This talk delves into Chat-Oriented Programming, an emerging paradigm where Large Language Models (LLMs) are leveraged to enhance and automate various stages of the development lifecycle.

We'll explore how LLMs are reshaping Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and transforming developer workflows. The presentation will demo the integration of both local and remote LLMs, demonstrating their practical applications in coding assistance, debugging, and even generating entire projects from high-level prompts.

Special attention will be given to Java's role in this AI-driven landscape, examining how one of the world's most popular programming languages adapts and thrives in the age of AI-augmented development ðŸ¤©
