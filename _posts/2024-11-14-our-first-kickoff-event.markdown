## The presentations

### The Era of AAP: Ai Augmented Programming (using Java)

**Speaker:**

[Stephan Janssen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanjanssen/) (Founder Devoxx(4kids/Genie), BeJUG, JCS. Co-Founder Voxxed Days)

**Description:**

As we enter the era of AI-Augmented Programming (AAP), developers stand at the threshold of a profound shift in software creation and maintenance. This talk delves into Chat-Oriented Programming, an emerging paradigm where Large Language Models (LLMs) are leveraged to enhance and automate various stages of the development lifecycle.

We'll explore how LLMs are reshaping Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and transforming developer workflows. The presentation will demo the integration of both local and remote LLMs, demonstrating their practical applications in coding assistance, debugging, and even generating entire projects from high-level prompts.

Special attention will be given to Java's role in this AI-driven landscape, examining how one of the world's most popular programming languages adapts and thrives in the age of AI-augmented development. ðŸ¤©

### DevOops

**Speakers:**

[Glenn Janssens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenn-janssens-89155517b/) (DevOps Engineer @ FlowFactor \|\| People Person \|\| Kubernetes Evangelist \|\| Healthy mind in a healthy body)

[Thomas Petit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-petit-4b736361/) (Cloud Integration Architect at Crelan)

**Description:**

Let's talk about the pain we're all feeling - the endless cycle of reinventing the wheel. We'll try to explore how DevOps tried to lead us to the promised land and where we got lost along the way.

We'll expose the gap between the shiny DevOps stories and the dumpster reality. Let's get brutally honest about the current state of affairs â€“ it's a bit of a shitshow, isn't it? Letâ€™s dissect our obsession with overcomplicating everything, and make a passionate plea for simplicity and share war stories from the trenches, highlighting the all-too-common pitfalls.

Finally, we'll offer a glimmer of hope, with practical strategies to simplify DevOps and reclaim our sanity. Let's work towards a future where DevOps is less complex, more fulfilling, and maybe even enjoyable. ðŸ˜ˆ
