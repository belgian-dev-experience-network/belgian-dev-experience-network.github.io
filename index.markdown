![bden_logo.jpeg](assets/bden_logo.jpeg){: width="300" style="float: left" } Weâ€™d like to welcome you to the **Belgian Dev Experience Network (BDEN)**! A community that brings together developers from all backgrounds and experience levels to share their experiences and learn from one another. Our goal is to build an educational and supportive environment for developers (and architects!).

We plan to offer a variety of **events, workshops, and online resources** to help developers stay up-to-date on the latest trends and best practices. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, we invite you to join the Belgian Dev Experience Network and become part of **a community dedicated to supporting and empowering developers**.
