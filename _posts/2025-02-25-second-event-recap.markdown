# **BDEN Meetup #2 Recap: Platform Engineering, Security & Networking**

Our second **Belgian Developer Experience Network (BDEN)** event has come to a close, and what an incredible evening it was! üöÄ

This time, we delved into **Platform Engineering** and **Kubernetes**, exploring both the challenges and practical solutions developers face today. The event brought together an engaged audience, lively discussions, and valuable insights from our expert speakers.

## **Key Takeaways from the Talks**

### üîê **Bypassing Security Controls in the K8s Ecosystem**
**Speaker: [Philippe Bogaerts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippebogaerts/)**

Philippe took us on a deep dive into **Kubernetes security risks**, highlighting how attackers can bypass security controls and exploit vulnerabilities in cloud-native environments. He showcased real-world examples of security misconfigurations and shared best practices for protecting workloads.

One key message? **Security can‚Äôt be an afterthought**‚Äîas developers, we need to build with security in mind from the start.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Monitoring Applications Running on K8s with OpenTelemetry**
**Speaker: [Evelien Schellekens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelien-schellekens/)**

Evelien walked us through **how OpenTelemetry simplifies observability in Kubernetes**, making it easier for developers and platform teams to monitor applications effectively. Her talk covered **practical ways to collect and analyze metrics, logs, and traces** without breaking the bank, and the live demo gave attendees a real-world look at how powerful OpenTelemetry + Elastic can be.

The key takeaway? **Better observability doesn‚Äôt have to come with a big price tag‚Äîit‚Äôs all about leveraging the right tools efficiently.**

## **Networking, Food & Community**

After the sessions, we gathered for a relaxed **networking event** over **delicious pizza** üçï. It was great to see developers, platform engineers, and security enthusiasts exchanging ideas, sharing experiences, and making new connections. Events like these remind us of why BDEN exists‚Äîto **bring developers together, learn from each other, and grow as a community**.

## **What‚Äôs Next?**

A huge **thank you** to everyone who joined, asked insightful questions, and contributed to making this event a success! We‚Äôre already planning our **next BDEN meetup**, so stay tuned for details.

We can‚Äôt wait to see you all again soon!
