## Welcome to the Third BDEN Meetup!

Welcome back to the Belgian Developer Experience Network!

After two successful events in November and February, where we rather focused on AI and platform engineering, we’re turning our attention to hands-on developer topics.

Save the date: **12th of June** at AE in Leuven. The agenda is still taking shape, and we’ll share the full program in the coming weeks.

Get ready for insightful talks from experienced professionals, lively discussions, and the opportunity to connect with fellow developers passionate about building software.
Whether you're a seasoned software developer, a platform engineer or just starting to explore this exciting field, join us for an evening of learning, sharing, and growing
together.
