## Welcome to the Second BDEN Meetup!

Welcome back to the Belgian Developer Experience Network!

After a fantastic kick-off event in November where we explored the foundations of our community, we're diving deep into a topic that's transforming the way we develop and deploy software: Platform Engineering.

This time, we'll be tackling the crucial intersection of security, developer responsibilities, and platform engineering, with a focus on practical strategies and real-world challenges.

Get ready for insightful talks from experienced professionals, lively discussions, and the opportunity to connect with fellow developers passionate about building software. 
Whether you're a seasoned platform engineer or just starting to explore this exciting field, join us for an evening of learning, sharing, and growing together.

## The presentations

### Bypassing Security Controls in the K8s Ecosystem

**Speaker:**

[Philippe Bogaerts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippebogaerts/) (Public Cloud System Engineer and Co-Founder of BruCON)

**Description:**

Kubernetes, its surrounding ecosystem, and microservices are inherently complex systems with numerous potential attack vectors targeting data theft, cryptocurrency mining, and other threats. The attack surface is vast. 

Many security controls fail to provide an acceptable level of protection and are often easily bypassed. By examining the problem from various angles, this talk will explore where and how to effectively secure applications, workloads, and clusters, leveraging the principles of CNAPP (Cloud Native Application Protection Platforms). 

To conclude, weâ€™ll examine how AI and its associated frameworks further complicate the security landscape. 

This session aims to shed light on how collective awareness of these security challenges can lead to better protection for everyone.

### Platform Engineering on a Budget

**Speaker:**

[Tim Speetjens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timspeetjens/) (Platform Engineer at paradigm.brussels)

**Description:**

In this session we will introduce you to Platform Engineering, how practices evolved and why it's important.

Since some time, developer portals have emerged, which try to fill this space, however, we can already get quite far by just leveraging Infrastructure as Code, GitOps and CI/CD.

We will focus on enabling developer flow, enabling different application teams to use internal tools effectively, and trying to make them converge to common standards and golden paths.
