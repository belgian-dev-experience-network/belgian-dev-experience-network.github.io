### **BDEN Meetup #4 – Hands-On with Helm**

On **October 21st**, the **Belgian Developer Experience Network (BDEN)** community came together once again. This time at **FlowFactor’s office in Kontich** for an evening that traded slide decks for keyboards.

After covering everything from **AI and Java** to **Platform Engineering and DevSecOps** in previous meetups, this edition took a different turn: a **hands-on workshop** all about **testing and validating Helm charts**.

### **Workshop: Helm Chart Unit & Integration Testing**

**Instructor: [Glenn Janssens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenn-janssens-89155517b/)** *(DevOps Engineer @ FlowFactor)*

Instead of passively listening, participants rolled up their sleeves and got to work under the guidance of **Glenn Janssens**, who led an **interactive session** on building reliable, testable Helm charts.

The workshop covered both **unit and integration testing** approaches, focusing on how to catch issues early and keep Helm deployments stable. Glenn demonstrated practical tools and patterns for improving feedback loops and shared tips for integrating tests into CI/CD pipelines.

### **Food, Networking & Flow**

After the workshop, everyone gathered for **food, drinks, and conversations** 🍕🍻. From discussing Helm best practices to swapping CI/CD horror stories, the evening wrapped up in true BDEN fashion. With knowledge shared, connections made, and plenty of laughs.  

It was great to see both familiar faces and new ones joining the community, proving once again that **BDEN is as much about people as it is about tech**.

### **Looking Ahead**

A huge **thank you** to **Glenn** for the engaging session and to **everyone** who participated and brought their curiosity and good vibes. 🙌
