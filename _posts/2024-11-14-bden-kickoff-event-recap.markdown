This past 14/11, we hosted the first-ever **Belgian Dev Experience Network (BDEN)** event, and it was an incredible success! Developers from diverse backgrounds came together for an evening filled with knowledge-sharing, laughter, and networking.

Here’s a quick look at what made the night memorable:

 * **The Era of AI Augmented Programming (using Java) by [Stephan Janssen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanjanssen/)**: Stephan shared a thought-provoking session on "The Era of AI Augmented Programming (using Java)", sparking great conversations and ideas among attendees. He talked about the various LLM models out there and what makes each of them special. If you're a Java developer and looking to play around with them, be sure to check out his IntelliJ IDEA plugin [DevoxxGenie](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24169-devoxxgenie)!

 * **Axe Throwing & Networking:** After the informative sessions, attendees got to unwind with an exciting axe throwing activity, accompanied by pizza and drinks. It was the perfect way to build connections and relax in a fun environment.
