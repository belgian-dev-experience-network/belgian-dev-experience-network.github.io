### **BDEN Meetup #3 â€“ Hands-On Developer Experience**

On **June 12th**, we gathered at **AE in Leuven** for the **third Belgian Developer Experience Network (BDEN) meetup**. After previous editions touched on **AI** and **Platform Engineering**, this time we zoomed in on **practical, developer-focused topics**.  

The evening combined **thought-provoking talks**, **live demos**, and plenty of opportunities to connect with fellow developers.

### **The Talks**

#### ðŸ”º **DevSecOps: A Love Triangle**
**Speaker: [Burr Sutter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/burrsutter/)** (Java Champion, Director of Developer Experience @ Red Hat)

Burr opened the night with his signature energy, exploring the sometimes messyâ€”but essentialâ€”relationship between **Dev, Sec, and Ops**. By drawing parallels with the drama of love triangles, he highlighted how these roles often clash, yet depend on one another to succeed.  

With **live demonstrations** featuring **Internal Developer Platforms, Backstage, Kubernetes, and the CNCF ecosystem**, Burr showed what it takes to move from friction to collaboration. His takeaway? **Harmony is possible, but only if teams embrace shared responsibility.**

#### â˜• **From Reactive to Virtual: Simplifying with Javaâ€™s Virtual Threads**
**Speaker: [Alex Wauters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-wauters/)** (CTO @ Customaite.ai)

Next, Alex shared how his team at **Customaite.ai** transitioned from a **reactive programming model with Quarkus Mutiny** to embracing **Javaâ€™s Virtual Threads**.  

The shift wasnâ€™t just about performanceâ€”it was about **writing cleaner, easier-to-maintain code**. Alex also walked us through the **custom patterns** they built to fill in gaps around **structured concurrency**, giving attendees practical advice they could take back to their own projects.

### **Community, Conversations & Connections**

As always, the evening wasnâ€™t just about the talks. Over **food and drinks**, attendees shared experiences, debated ideas, and connected with peers from across the Belgian developer community.  

The buzz in the room was proof that BDEN is more than just a meetupâ€”itâ€™s becoming a place where developers **learn, collaborate, and grow together**.
