## Welcome to the Fourth BDEN Meetup!
Welcome back to the Belgian Developer Experience Network!

Three fantastic events have passed covering everything from AI and Java to Platform Engineering and DevSecOps, so we're excited to switch gears for our fourth meetup. This time, we're hosting a hands-on workshop focused on a critical tool in the cloud-native ecosystem: Helm.

Join us on **October 21st, 2025**, at the **FlowFactor office in Kontich** for an evening dedicated to "Testing and validating Helm Charts." Instead of traditional talks, this session will be an interactive workshop designed to give you practical skills. **So don't forget you bring your laptop or portable!**

Whether you're new to Helm or looking to solidify your testing strategies, this workshop will provide valuable insights and help you locate issues in your charts. Get ready to connect with fellow developers, learn new techniques, and elevate your Helm game.
